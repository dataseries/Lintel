2008-05-09: 
   * Switched over to using cmake for building instead of autoconf.  This
     change is intended to move us toward being able to build on Windows.
     As part of this change, we discovered that boost support is pretty 
     much required, so explicitly made it so. Also, dropped support for 
     gc and makebits; those are both old and unused.  

2008-03-23: 
   * Clock routines now check for frequency scaling and will not continue
     if frequency scaling is enabled and the user has not accepted potentially
     incorrect results.

2008-03-04:
   * Add segment plotting to mercury-plot

2008-02-14:
   * Added tar batch-parallel module for taking a group of files in
     directories and creating tar files out of them of a specified size.

2008-02-08:
   * Added documentation generation/installation; depends on cmake to work
     since eventually we will transition entirely to cmake.

2008-02-05:
   * Add a RotatingHashMap class that is useful for aging out old
     values from a cache with low overhead.
