2008-06-23: 
  * Lintel should work on Cygwin.  The environment variable to
    control the number of processors in PThread was changed to
    NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS from LINTEL_NCPUS to match with what windows sets.
     
2008-06-12: 
  * New make batch-parallel module that is a little easier to use
    for doing simple transforms than writing a new module.

2008-06-11: 
  * LintelFind cmake module that has support for searching for
    includes, libraries and programs in a standard way that either requires
    a dependency or gives the user a WITH_... variable to control if
    it should be used.

2008-06-05: 
  * Added LintelDocs cmake module for building documentation in the
    same way in all packages.

2008-05-26: 
  * Added PointerUtil.hpp header file that performs safe casting of
    bother pointers and boost::shared_ptr's.

2008-05-25: 
  * Added LintelLog tools for performing very low overhead logging
    w/o requiring any additional code beyond just writing the debugging 
    statements.

2008-05-23: 
  * Added SimpleMutex class that can be used without linking with -lpthread.

2008-05-19: 
  * Removed all uses of LintelAssert from the source code.

2008-05-09: 
  * Switched over to using cmake for building instead of autoconf.  
    This change is intended to move us toward being able to build on Windows.
    As part of this change, we discovered that boost support is pretty 
    much required, so explicitly made it so. Also, dropped support for 
    gc and makebits; those are both old and unused.  

2008-04-02: 
  * PThreadAutoLocker class renamed to PThreadScopedLock to follow
    the boost naming convention

2008-03-23: 
  * Clock routines now check for frequency scaling and will not 
    continue if frequency scaling is enabled and the user has not
    accepted potentially incorrect results.

2008-03-21: 
  * Transitioned to includes as .hpp rather than .H; old .H files 
    still exist for transition.  A warning will be put in for one
    release, and then they will be removed.

2008-03-04: 
  * Add segment plotting to mercury-plot

2008-02-14: 
  * Added tar batch-parallel module for taking a group of files in
    directories and creating tar files out of them of a specified size.

2008-02-08: 
  * Added documentation generation/installation; depends on
    cmake to work since eventually we will transition entirely to cmake.

2008-02-05: 
  * Add a RotatingHashMap class that is useful for aging out
    old values from a cache with low overhead.
