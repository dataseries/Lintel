Add more external documentation (use doxygen?)

There are many things in Lintel that should be replaced with better and/or
more standard things from (e.g.) boost or std::tr1. For data structures,
also remember to check relative performance first.

add a test that checks whether or not we need '-Dstd=' rather than
guessing based on HP-UX compiler version

figure out how to generate weak symbols so that we can have libnogc.so
included in libLintel.so and if people want to enable garbage
collection they can add it in and it just works. -- this is the same
trick as is done by libpthread
     
add in an option to StatsQuantile that controls directly the memory
used, and makes a tradeoff between the Nbound and the error so that
it's roughly balanced.

add support for checking of the lintel version into the
HPL_REQUIRELIB_LINTEL bit.

Figure out how to make a meta-macro that generates the
HPL_{REQUIRELIB,WITHLIB}_{XML2,LZF,LZO,...} since all of those macros
are so similar; a generalization of HPL_DEFINE_REQUIRELIB might work,
but we want to check for various functions being defined, see the
example HPL_REQUIRELIB_XML2 functions.
