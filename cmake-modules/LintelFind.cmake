# Macro for finding binaries, headers, and libraries; also does all of
# the WITH_xxx support so users can disable libraries that they have
# installed but don't want to use.  Normally you would use the
# LINTEL_WITH_* or LINTEL_REQUIRED_* variants of the macros.

# LINTEL_FIND_HEADER(variable header) sets ${variable}_INCLUDE_DIR,
#   ${variable}_INCLUDES, and ${variable}_ENABLED.
#
#   Normally you would use LINTEL_WITH_HEADER or LINTEL_REQUIRED_HEADER
#
#   The header must exist if ${variable}_FIND_REQUIRED is set.
#   It also sets up an option WITH_${variable} unless
#   ${variable}_FIND_REQUIRED is on.  It sets ${variable}_ENABLED based
#   on finding the header and WITH_${variable}; you can set 
#   ${variable}_EXTRA_INCLUDE_PATHS to specify additional locations it 
#   should look, and ${variable}_EXTRA_INCLUDES to specify extra directories 
#   to put in the ${variable}_INCLUDES variable.

# LINTEL_FIND_LIBRARY(variable header libname) sets
#   ${variable}_LIBRARIES, and ${variable}_ENABLED after calling
#   LINTEL_FIND_HEADER to find the header.
#
#   Normally you would use LINTEL_WITH_LIBRARY or LINTEL_REQUIRED_LIBRARY
#
#   The library must exist if ${variable}_FIND_REQUIRED is set.  You
#   can set ${variable}_EXTRA_LIBRARIES to specify extra libraries to
#   put in the ${variable}_LIBRARIES variable.  ${variable}_LIBRARY
#   will be set to the file containing the library without any of its
#   dependencies.

# LINTEL_FIND_PROGRAM(variable program) sets ${variable}_PATH The
#   program must exist if ${variable}_FIND_REQUIRED is set.  The search
#   will look in ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}, ${variable}_EXTRA_PATHS, 
#   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin, and the default system paths.
#
#   Normally you would use LINTEL_WITH_PROGRAM or LINTEL_REQUIRED_PROGRAM

# LINTEL_WITH_*(...) adds an option WITH_${variable}, and sets
#   ${variable}_ENABLED if the thing was found and we should use it.  If
#   we should use it and it was not found, a message is printed out
#   explaining what was not found.  If ${variable}_MISSING_EXTRA is set,
#   that string is also printed.

# LINTEL_REQUIRED_*(...) tries to find the thing and produces and
#   error message if it is not found.  If ${variable}_MISSING_EXTRA is
#   set, that string is also printed.

# LINTEL_FIND_LIBRARY_CMAKE_INCLUDE_FILE(variable header libname) is
# the macro for putting in one of the FindX files; it properly chooses
# between LINTEL_FIND_LIBRARY and LINTEL_WITH_LIBRARY depending on
# whether ${variable}_FIND_REQUIRED is set. Boilerplate for the header
# of the FindX file can be found below next to the macro.

# LINTEL_BOOST_EXTRA(variable header libname) assumes you have already
# included FindBoost; it searches for header and libname and checks
# that the directories are compatible.  If ${variable}_FIND_REQUIRED
# is set, it uses LINTEL_FIND_LIBRARY, otherwise LINTEL_WITH_LIBRARY.
# You can specify the special value None for libname if the boost library
# is header only.

# LINTEL_FIND_PERL_MODULE(module_name variable) searches for a
# particular perl module, and sets ${variable}_ENABLED 

# You can set the LINTEL_FIND_DEBUG variable to enable debugging

# TODO: there is a bunch of duplicate code in the below macros,
# eliminate it.
