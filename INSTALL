Short compilation instructions, see doc/building.html for more
complete instructions, including how to compile so you can add
sources, binaries, etc.

* Simplest:

  ./configure && make && make check

  Note in this case make install will probably not work unless you are root.


* Simple:

  ./configure --enable-optmode=optimize && make && make check && make install

  This should automatically set the install prefix to .. if you are in
  the source directory, so a make install will put files under
  ../{bin,include,lib}

* Standard

  mkdir ~/build/optimize  (or debug, profile)
  cd ~/build/optimize
  .../Lintel/configure --enable-optmode=optimize (or debug, profile)
  make && make check && make install

  This is the standard way of building, it allows you to have Lintel 
  compiled in multiple different ways at the same time using the same
  source tree.
