IMPORTANT INFORMATION

The Lintel package is a general utility package, e.g. data-structures,
algorithms, tools, etc.  Individually none of the pieces are large enough to be
worth distributing separately; combined they make a useful collection of tools
for development.

The Lintel package is open source under a BSD License, the full license terms
are in the file COPYING. Please send bug reports, requests for improvements,
and general discussion to lintel-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

INSTALLING BINARY PACKAGES / COMPILING FROM SOURCE

You can use Lintel either by installing a binary package or by compiling it
from source.  If you compile from source you can either get the release source
files that are the same version as the binary packages, or you can get the
source from version control which will give you a more current but less tested
version of the source code.  To build from source you may need to install
required packages and may want to install optional ones.  doc/dependencies.txt
will show dependencies for some standard operating systems.

1) Installing binary packages
   # Download the repository signing key
   wget http://tesla.hpl.hp.com/opensource/repositories/signing-key-latest.gpg
   # Install the repository signing key
   apt-key add filename # DEB
   cp filename /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/tesla-opensource-key # RPM
   # Pick your repository from http://tesla.hpl.hp.com/opensource/repositories
   # and add it to /etc/apt/sources.list.d or /etc/yum.repos.d
   $EDITOR filename
   # Install the packages
   apt-get install liblintel-dev # DEB
   yum install Lintel-devel # RPM

2) Installing from the tar source file releases
   # Download the build tool
   cd ~ && wget http://tesla.hpl.hp.com/opensource/deptool-bootstrap
   # Download and unpack the sources
   perl deptool-bootstrap tarinit http://tesla.hpl.hp.com/opensource/sources/latest-release
   # Build, install (-t = and test) the programs
   cd ~/projects/DataSeries && perl ~/deptool-bootstrap build -t

3) Installing from version control
   # Download the build tool
   cd ~ && wget http://tesla.hpl.hp.com/opensource/deptool-bootstrap
   # Initialize the source repository (leave off the server option inside HPL)
   perl deptool-bootstrap init --server=github.com dataseries/Lintel dataseries/DataSeries
   # Checkout the source code
   perl deptool-bootstrap checkout DataSeries
   # Build, install (-t = and test) the programs
   cd ~/projects/DataSeries && perl ~/deptool-bootstrap build -t
