If this README file is in ~/.dotfiles; then it was copied out of some Lintel version, you can
update or initialize your dotfiles by running .../Lintel/src/dotfiles/setup; the commands to see
what has changes will be printed to the screen.

These dotfiles are the shared ones that part of our group has been using for several years.  They
have many useful functions for interfacing between zsh and deptool, they also set up an environment
which is relatively productive.  Because they are derived from one person's dotfiles, they also
have some remaining cruft in them that was mostly cleaned up when they were incorportated into
Lintel, there is likely some remaining bits needed.

Customization is handled by creating the file ~/.<whatever>.{early,late}; the .early variant will
be applied at the beginning of the .<whatever> file and can be used to set variables for
customization.  The .late variant will be applied at the end of the .<whatever> file, and can be
used to build additional customization and/or override decisions made in the common files.  This
customization is currently present for emacs, zshrc, and zshenv.
