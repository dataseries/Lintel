<h1>Generating and using Makefiles</h1>

<p>
Pretty much everything gets a <code>Makefile</code> (please note the
capitalization of the file name).

<h3>Makefile targets</h3>
There are two types of Makefile targets - those that every package should
provide, and those that sahould be there, but aren't strictly required.

<h4>Required targets:</h4>
<dl>
  <dt><code>build</code>
  <dd>the first, and thus default, target: should build the package, producing
      libraries/binaries as approprriate (the <em>deliverables</em>); 
      Typically there are 4 types of deliverables:
      <ul>
      <li> <em>debug</em> - all debugging information and asserts
      <li> <em>profile</em> - built for profiling
      <li> <em>optimize</em> - built using O2 optimizing, and containing asserts.
      <li> <em>optimize-full</em> - higher optimization, all asserts removed.
      </ul>
      For most packages, optimize is the default level. If it is, the
      <code>debug</code> target <b>must</b> exist.<br>
      The build target should also install copies of the deliverables
      in <tt>../{lib,bin,include}</tt>, so that they can be used by other
      packages.

  <dt><code>rebuild</code>
  <dd>realclean + build

  <dt><code>install</code>
  <dd>Will install copies of the package in a specified directory. All SSP
      packages will install into the directory immediately above the package
      directory by default. This is also done by <code>build</code>.

  <dt><code>install-docs</code>
  <dd>Copies documentation from the docs directory to somewhere in your
	web server directory (for SSP, <code>~ssp/WWW/</code>).

  <dt><code>depend</code>
  <dd>rebuilds dependancy information, using <code>makedepend</code>. This is
        also done automatically by <code>build</code>.

  <dt><code>clean</code>
  <dd>deletes object modules and other junk

  <dt><code>realclean</code>
  <dd>requires <code>clean</code>; also deletes the package deliverables.

  <dt><code>regression</code>
  <dd>builds and runs standard tests, comparing output.

  <dt><code>build.regression</code>
  <dd>builds new regression test output. <b>Be absolutely sure that your
      changes are correct before doing this!</b>

</dl>


<h4>Optional targets:</h4>
<dl>
  <dt><code>all</code>
  <dd>Makes and installs all versions of the deliverables. 

  <dt><code>export</code>
  <dd>only applicable to packages that have been "approved" for outside export
        (see <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/itc/csl/ssp/software/">
        here</a> for a list and details). This target should build a version
        of the package that doesn't include information that we do not wish to 
        have disclosed outside the company.

  <dt><code>debug</code>
  <dd>builds and installs debug version of the package as the default

  <dt><code>optimize</code>
  <dd>builds and installs optimized version of the package as the default

  <dt><code>profile</code>
  <dd>builds and installs profiled version of the package as the default

  <dt><code>install.ssp</code>
  <dd>installs deliverables into /mount/ssp.

  <dt><code>nodep</code>
  <dd>For large packages, the depend step can take a while. This can be
      annoying if you're in a tight debug cycle, and you know you aren't
      changing dependancies with your edits. <code>nodep</code> should
      do the same as <code>debug</code>, without doing the <code>depend</code>
      step.
</dl>

<h2>Generating a new Makefile</h2>

You can build a Makefile in any fashion that seems reasonable to you (as
long as it complies with the rules above). However, almost all of our
software uses <tt>Make.common</tt> from the Lintel package to simplify
life. Make.common provides a set of variables (customized by the operating
system that you're using) and functions that can be used in your Makefile,
taking care of doing most of the grungy details.

<p>
Things you need to do to use Make.common:
<ul>
<li> Define the build targets
<li> include Make.common
<li> For a target foo, define foo_objs (the objects to be built)
<li> Define SRCS or DEPEND_SRCS so that <tt>make depend</tt> will work
<li> Define your default target to be the debug or optimize target, as
     appropriate.
<li> Add the rest of the stuff you need (install, clean etc)
</ul>

A very simple example for the foo program could be:
<pre>
    build: depend foo
    include ../Lintel/Make.common
    foo_sources := foo.C foo2.C
    foo_objs := $(foo_sources:.C=.o)
    DEPEND_SRCS = $(foo_sources)
    foo: foo-debug
            [ ! -f foo ] || rm -f foo
	    ln foo-debug foo

    $(call debug_program_target,foo)
</pre>

This should work to build foo on all architectures and OS's.

Below are some more details on the Make.common facilities, and how to
use them.

<h4>Target generation</h4>

Make.common provides a set of "special" variable declarations that can be
used to generate default targets of various kinds. These are currently
<code>{debug,profile,optimize,optimize-full}_{lib,program}_target</code>. 
They are used as in the
example above - use <tt>call</tt> with the target and name of the thing to be
built, and it will generate the rules to build a target with the appropriate
compiler flags (debuggable, profiled or optimized) and type (standalone
program or library). In the example above, the call function results in the
rules to make foo-debug being defined.

<p>
You can define lots of different targets for different programs in the
same Makefile. These are customized with the following variables (N.B.
<i>foo</i> is used as a placeholder for the target name).
<dl>
    <dt> foo_objs
    <dd> The object files that will be generated. Mandatory

    <dt> foo_deps
    <dd> Dependancies to be included in the target. Typically used for
         library dependancies, where both the library and program are
	 built in the same package. Optional

    <dt> foo_libs
    <dd> libraries to be used to build foo. Optional

    <dt> foo_flags
    <dd> extra flags to be used to compile foo. Optional
</dl>

<h4>Dependancy generation</h4>

Make.common contains everything needed for dependancy generation, except
the list of files for which dependancies must be built. This should be
placed in either the SRCS or DEPEND_SRCS variables. Many people like to
use SRCS as the list of source files. However, when this list contains
files that are automatically generated, you may not wish to have 'make
depend' consider them. In this case, you can define DEPEND_SRCS as the
subset independant of these files, and it will take priority over
SRCS. Note that there is an important tradeoff here: 'make depend' will
work perfectly well, even if the files for which dependancies are being
generated do not exist - however, it will print a warning informing you
of this, which may be annoying. However, by not including generated files
in the dependancy list, you won't get dependancy information for that file.

<h4>Predefined targets</h4>

Make.common also defines some commonly used targets. <tt>depend</tt> is
covered above. <tt>clean</tt> is also predefined
to delete many files, including all object and core files. You can add
to clean rules by using a double-colon clean rule, e.g.
<pre>
    clean::
            -rm -f my-clean-file
</pre>

<h4>Predefined variables</h4>

Make.common also defines some variables that may be useful in defining your
own rules:
<dl>
    <dt> CXX
    <dd> the C++ compiler to be used

    <dt> COMMON_FLAGS
    <dd> flags that should be defined for every compile

    <dt> YACC_FLAGS
    <dd> extra flags to use for compiling yacc-generated files

    <dt> YACC_LIBS
    <dd> libraries to link with YACC generated programs

    <dt> {DEBUG,PROFILE,OPTIMIZE}_FLAGS
    <dd> flags to use for each of the compile classes. Includes COMMON_FLAGS

    <dt> OS
    <dd> The OS type of the system

    <dt> OS_REVISION
    <dd> The OS version of the system
</dl>

As well as defining your own rules, these variables can be used for other
things. As examples, consider if you have some programs in your package
that are operating system dependant. The you can do something like:

<pre> 
    BINARIES := foo bar
    ifeq ($(OS),HP-UX)
        BINARIES += baz
    endif
</pre>

which will result in BINARIES being set to "foo bar" for all systems,
except HP_UX, where it will be set to "foo bar baz".

As another example, files generated with yacc often include constructs
that cause warnings when compiled with the default compiler flags. These
warnings can be suppressed by compiling with YACC_FLAGS. The best way
of doing this is setting the compile flags for that file. e.g. for a 
file parse.C, which has been generated by parse.y, the line:
<pre>
    parse_flags := $(YACC_FLAGS)
</pre>
will have this effect.

<h4>CXXFLAGS</h4>

Finally, you need to be able to specify your own compiler options for all
files. This can be done with the CXXFLAGS variable. A typical minimal example
is:

<pre>
    CXXFLAGS := -I.
</pre>

Per-file options can be set with the <i>foo</i>_flags variable.

<H4>Separating out the Makefile</H4>

<P>It can be useful to keep pieces of the makefile divided into
multiple, logically independent pieces.  You can put files called
<I>target</I>.mk into the same directory as the Makefile. These will
be included; one nice form is to make one for each target binary or
library. </P>

<P>You can also make files called <CODE>subdir.mk</CODE> in the direct
subdirectories of the makefile.  A sample one of these would be: </P>

<PRE>
# First we list the source files
SRC_BASE := Buttress_Creek.C Filament.C LoomReal.C Shuttle.C \
            Buttress_Store.C Loom.C LoomSimulator.C Timer.C

# Then we transform them so that they are in the base directory
SRC_BASE := $(foreach file,$(SRC_BASE),base/$(file))
# Then we turn them into object files.
OBJ_BASE := $(SRC_BASE:.C=.o)

# Add our sources to the list of all sources
SRCS += $(SRC_BASE)

# Add the flags we need to compile, and the flags other people will
# use to acces us.

CXXFLAGS += -I$(ROME_SRC)/base -I$(ROME_SRC)/statements -I$(ROME_SRC)/attributes -Ibase

# Add the target to clean up after compilation.
clean::
        -(cd base; rm *\~ *.o *.Do *.Po *.Oo) 2>/dev/null

</PRE>

<H2>Commentary on CommonMake</H2>

<P>CommonMake helps a fair bit with making the Makefiles easier to
write.  It eliminates the need for the Makefile.local.template file,
and moves all the compilation flags to a common place, so we know that
everything is using the same options.  It also supports parallel make
across directories in a single package, which lets us use directories
without concern that we're going to get much worse performance, even
dependencies between directories in a package are handled
correctly.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, it also has some problems.  First, Writing Makefiles
is still a little tedious.  In particular, the need to write three
parallel copies of the targets for the three different versions.  I
have thought at times about writing a script to pre-process the
makefiles (ala Makefile.PL), but couldn't convince myself this was a
good idea</P>

<P>Second, doing more than two levels of makefiles is hard, I tried
this once for Ergastulum, and then abandoned it.  Basically the
subdir.mk files have to include further down subdir.mk files.  Also
it's obnoxious then to move directories around, as the subdir.mk files
have a notion of where they live.  Again this could be fixed by a
pre-processing script, again it's not clear it's worth the work.</P>

<P>Third, inter-package dependencies are not handled at all.  The
correct thing to do is for each package to have a location independent
makefile, so that other packages can just include that makefile, and
make a dependency on whatever they need (e.g. libSRTlite.O.a,
libRome-debug.a), and then automagically things will be built as
necessary.  In addition, this would mean that parallel compiles would
be able to run across everything.</P>

<P>All of the commonmake stuff tries to avoid using recursive make.
