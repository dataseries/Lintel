    abstract = {This paper presents a replication protocol that ensures even-
tual consistency in large-scale distributed systems subject to network
partitions and asynchrony. A simulation study shows that the resulting
protocol is scalable and achieves high throughput under load.
Our protocol does not rely on any form of consensus, which would lead
to block the replicas in case of partitions and asynchrony. Our protocol
instead ensures that (1) updates are continuously applied to the replicas
and (2) no two updates are ever performed in a different order. Gaps
might occur during periods of unreliable communication. They are filled
whenever connectivity is provided, and consistency is then eventually en-
sured, but without any conscious commitment. That is, there is no point
in the computation when replicas know that consistency is achieved. This
unconsciousness is the key to tolerating perpetual asynchrony with no
consensus support.}
