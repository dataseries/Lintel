 abstract = {Pangaea is a wide-area file system that supports data sharing among a community of widely distributed users. It is built on a symmetrically decentralized infrastructure that consists of commodity computers provided by the end users. Computers act autonomously to serve data to their local users. When possible, they exchange data with nearby peers to improve the system's overall performance, availability, and network economy. This approach is realized by aggressively creating a replica of a file whenever and wherever it is accessed.This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Pangaea file system. Pangaea offers efficient, randomized algorithms to manage highly dynamic and potentially large groups of file replicas. It applies optimistic consistency semantics to replica contents, but it also offers stronger guarantees when required by the users. The evaluation demonstrates that Pangaea outperforms existing distributed file systems in large heterogeneous environments, typical of the Internet and of large corporate intranets.}

  abstract  = {We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a fully distributed directory service for Farsite, a logically centralized file system that is physically implemented on a loosely coupled network of desktop computers. Prior to this work, the Farsite system included distributed mechanisms for file content but centralized mechanisms for file metadata. Our distributed directory service introduces tree-structured file identifiers that support dynamically partitioning metadata at arbitrary granularity, recursive path leases for scalably maintaining name-space consistency, and a protocol for consistently performing operations on files managed by separate machines. It also mitigates metadata hotspots via file-field leases and the new mechanism of disjunctive leases. We experimentally show that Farsite can dynamically partition file-system metadata while maintaining full file-system semantics.}
