---++ Paper citation format:

  Currently (2009-Jun) recommended citation format for papers is:
    first-author:citation-description:venue
  
  For example:
    ghemawat:google-fs:sosp2003, alpern:myth-scalable-high-perf:ppsc1995
  
  The rationale is that some people remember a paper by author, or by
  citation or by venue.  An earlier attempt included co-authors as
  +last-name-initials, but the extra characters didn't seem to help with
  memory, although with the prior format skipping some of the other
  pieces, it helped with disambiguation.

---++ Book citation format:

  Recommended format for books is still under flux.

---++ Web citation format:

  Recommended citation format for web sites is still under flux, pick
  one from the web-sites.bib file, or make up a new one.  A few things
  are checked:

    1) web-sites.bib should have only @misc{ entries, they need to
       start at the beginning of a line, and have no spaces in the
       above shown part.

    2) Exactly one of a '  author =' or '  key =' should be present in
       each entry.  The two leading spaces are required, and a space
       after author or key.

    3) Each reference should have a note that includes a '\url{...}'
       value, and an 'Accessed <month> <year>' It is recommended to
       not include a . after the url as that could be confusing.
       Because of the way the check is done, this all has to be on one
       line.

TODO: add some test that loads all the .bib files to make sure they are clean.
