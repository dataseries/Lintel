Currently (2009-Jun) recommended citation format for papers is:
  first-author:citation-description:venue

For example:
  ghemawat:google-fs:sosp2003, alpern:myth-scalable-high-perf:ppsc1995

The rationale is that some people remember a paper by author, or by
citation or by venue.  An earlier attempt included co-authors as
+last-name-initials, but the extra characters didn't seem to help with
memory, although with the prior format skipping some of the other
pieces, it helped with disambiguation.

Recommended format for books and web sites is still under flux.


TODO: add some test that loads all the .bib files to make sure they are clean.
