---++ How to add new citations
  If the venue exists (web-sites.bib and tr.bib) add the new cite to the venue.

  Don't include conference information directly, use a crossref and
  fill in names-long.bib AND names-short.bib.  See, for example, sosp.bib

---++ How to cite bibs in latex

  The command LINTEL_LATEX(foo) in the CMakeLists.txt file for your document
  foo will make sure that foo.tex is built.

  To include bib entries from Lintel, there are two options. 
    (1) List the various venues from which you cite, e.g.,
        "\bibliography{sosp,asplos,fast}"
    (2) Simply include everything: "\bibliography{lintel-latex-all}"

   If you don't include everything, you need to choose either names-long or
   names-short to go at the end.

   lintel-latex-short instead of all will use short names.

   TODO-joe: did I break option 1?  Will require even fancier stuff if
   my suggestion doesn't work


  To pass options through to Lintel, include a command such as the following in
  the appropriate CMakeLists.txt file:
    SET(foo_LINTEL_LATEX_ARGS  --papr a4  --error-on-warnings)
  Options such as "--tex path", "--bst path", and "--bib path" are useful for
  documents with materials in multiple directories.


---++ Paper citation format:

  Currently (2009-Jun) recommended citation format for papers is:
    first-author:citation-description:venue
  
  For example:
    ghemawat:google-fs:sosp2003, alpern:myth-scalable-high-perf:ppsc1995
  
  The rationale is that some people remember a paper by author, or by
  citation or by venue.  An earlier attempt included co-authors as
  +last-name-initials, but the extra characters didn't seem to help with
  memory, although with the prior format skipping some of the other
  pieces, it helped with disambiguation.

---++ Book citation format:

  Recommended format for books is still under flux.

---++ Web citation format:

  Recommended citation format for web sites is still under flux, pick
  one from the web-sites.bib file, or make up a new one.  A few things
  are checked:

    1) web-sites.bib should have only @misc{ entries, they need to
       start at the beginning of a line, and have no spaces in the
       above shown part.

    2) Exactly one of a '  author =' or '  key =' should be present in
       each entry.  The two leading spaces are required, and a space
       after author or key.

    3) Each reference should have a note that includes a '\url{...}'
       value, and an 'Accessed <month> <year>' It is recommended to
       not include a . after the url as that could be confusing.
       Because of the way the check is done, this all has to be on one
       line.
