  abstract = {This paper presents and evaluates the storage management
and caching in PAST, a large-scale peer-to-peer persistent
storage utility. PAST is based on a self-organizing, Internetbased
overlay network of storage nodes that cooperatively
route file queries, store multiple replicas of files, and cache
additional copies of popular files.
In the PAST system, storage nodes and files are each assigned
uniformly distributed identifiers, and replicas of a file
are stored at nodes whose identifier matches most closely the
files identifier. This statistical assignment of files to storage
nodes approximately balances the number of files stored on
each node. However, non-uniform storage node capacities
and file sizes require more explicit storage load balancing
to permit graceful behavior under high global storage utilization;
likewise, non-uniform popularity of files requires
caching to minimize fetch distance and to balance the query
load.
We present and evaluate PAST, with an emphasis on its
storage management and caching system. Extensive tracedriven
experiments show that the system minimizes fetch
distance, that it balances the query load for popular files,
and that it displays graceful degradation of performance as
the global storage utilization increases beyond 95%.}
