To install:
    make build

Everything will be installed in ../{bin,lib,tcl,include}. These directories
will be created if they don't already exist. Make sure that either the bin 
directory is in your path, or you edit the environment section (at the
top of the Makefile) to include the full path for buildTcl, or the second 
make step of the build will not succeed.

You will need Tcl installed on your system. If you're running HP-UX
within HP, you can use:
	ninstall -vh cello.hpl.hp.com opt_ssp.tcl_tk.8.3.0
Note that I think this installs into /usr/local, if you don't have this
directory, a good way to provide it is to create /opt/local, and then make
a link to this.

If you're using HP-UX externally to HP, you can get Tcl at the HP-UX
porting and archive centre: http://hpux.cae.wisc.edu/

On Linux systems, make sure that /usr/bin/awk points to mawk, not
gawk, or the compilation of the LintelTclCommands.C won't succeed.
Additionally, make sure that there's a link to tclsh in /usr/local/bin.
(This is where the sspinstall script expects to find it.)

For other operating systems (we have only tested on Linux) you're on
you're own.
