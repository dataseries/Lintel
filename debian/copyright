# TODO: maint guide says this is supposed to be a copy of the actual notice; but
# policy manual has a link to DEP-5 that says make it machine readable.
#
# TODO: As a side question for OSRB, we've accepted contributions; the patches didn't
# happen to come with an explicit copyright modification, but presumably that doesn't
# matter; how should we update the copyright file?
